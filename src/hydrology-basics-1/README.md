# Note on sonified data

SauzeData.txt contains the daily data for streamflow (Q), precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (PET).

The midi files Qpenta.mid, Ppenta.mid and PETpenta.mid have been created my mapping each variable into a E minor pentatonic scale using the webapp [musicalgorithms](http://musicalgorithms.org/4.1/app/).
